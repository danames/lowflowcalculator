		<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Low Flow Calculator™ computes a 
				streamflow value that represents an average low flow period for a specific 
				number of days with a given&nbsp;return period based on a historical data set 
				of daily streamflow observations.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Water quality modelers are often 
				interested in the "7Q10" streamflow as a representative dry condition to use in 
				modeling, particularly in cases where water quality is worst during low flow 
				periods (e.g. if it is dominated by point sources such as wastewater treatment 
				plants.) The 7Q10 streamflow is the yearly 7-day average low streamflow with a 
				10-year return period.</FONT></P>
		<P></P>
		<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Low Flow Calculator™ can also be 
				used to compute low streamflow periods other than 7Q10. For example, you can 
				use Low Flow Calculator™ to compute the expected low flow that will occur over 
				a two week period once every 100 years (i.e. the 100 year - two-week drought), 
				or the one-day low flow that will occur every 10 years.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, while the Low Flow 
				Calculator™ is primarily used for computing low streamflow with given return 
				periods, it can also be used to compute the expected <EM>high</EM> streamflow, 
				or flood, with a given return period.&nbsp; By choosing "High flow" from the 
				"Options|Change Parameters" menu, one can compute such quantities as the 
				100-year 4-day flood.&nbsp; </FONT>
