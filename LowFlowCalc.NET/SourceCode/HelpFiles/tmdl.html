					for TMDLs</STRONG></FONT></P>
		<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When estimating the total maximum 
				daily load (TMDL) of a contaminant in a stream, it is useful to use 
				conservative assumptions wherever possible to ensure a margin of 
				safety.&nbsp;One common conservative assumption is to use the&nbsp;"7Q10" 
				streamflow as a representative dry condition,&nbsp;particularly in cases where 
				water quality is worst during low flow periods (e.g. if it is dominated by 
				point sources such as wastewater treatment plants.) The 7Q10 streamflow is the 
				yearly 7-day average low streamflow with a 10-year return period.</FONT></P>

		<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EPA document, <I>Guidance for 
					Water Quality-Based Decisions: The TMDL Process</I>, states: <BLOCKQUOTE>When 
					developing a TMDL, design conditions are those critical conditions that must be 
					specified in order to determine attainment of water quality standards. In 
					specifying conditions in the waterbody, an attempt is made to use a reasonable 
					"worst case" condition. For example, stream analysis often uses a low flow 
					(e.g., 7-day low flow, once in 10-years commonly known as 7Q10 or 
					biologically-based 4-day 3-year flows) high temperature design condition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>To estimate the 7Q10 low streamflow at a particular location, you must have a 
					data set of observed (or modeled) daily streamflow records for several years at 
					the location.&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing data is accomodated in Low Flow Calculator™ by 
					only computing the 7-day average low flow for those periods where data 
					exist.&nbsp; Because of this,&nbsp;it is important that there be an adequate 
					number of consecutive observations each year in the daily streamflow 
					recordset.&nbsp; Use the Parameters dialog (accesible through the menu item: 
					"Options|Change Parameters") to set the averaging period to 7 days, and the 
					return period to 10 years.&nbsp; Ensure that the "Low flow" radio button is 
					selected, and choose the period of the year to be used for the computation 
					(typically January through December). The following figure shows the parameter 
					settings for a 7Q10 low streamflow calculation:</P>
				<P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="7q10params.gif"></P>
				<P>To use your data in Low Flow Calculator™, you must save it in an ASCII text 
					format, one line per observation, with dates and streamflow values separated by 
					commas or tabs. Load your data file into Low Flow Calculator™ using the 
					"File|Load Data File" menu item. The following figure shows the ASCII 
					formatting required by Low Flow Calculator™:</P>
				<P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="fileformat_tab.gif"></P>
				<P>Once your data file is loaded into Low Flow Calculator™, you can compute the 
					7Q10 low streamflow value by clicking the "Compute 7Q10" <IMG alt="" src="lightningbolt.gif" align="top">
					button on the tool bar.&nbsp; The results will be displayed in the "Report" 
					text area as shown below:</P>
				<P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="7q10results.gif">&nbsp;</P>
				<P>Results of the analysis will include an estimate of the 7Q10 low streamflow 
					value with 5% and 95% confidence limits.&nbsp; The confidence limits give you a 
					feel for the robustness of the 7Q10 estimate. The tighter the confidence 
					limits, the more confidence you can have in the 7Q10 estimate.&nbsp; Factors 
					that increase the confidence bounds include: using a small number of years of 
					data and using data that fluctuates dramatically year to year.
				</P>
				<P>Once you have computed the 7Q10 streamflow, you can use it in your computations 
					of contaminant load in a stream by multiplying it by the concentration of 
					contaminant.
